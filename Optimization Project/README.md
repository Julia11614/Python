## Project Overview

This project explores linear and integer programming optimization techniques applied to two distinct business problems. The project demonstrates the application of mathematical optimization methods to solve real-world decision-making challenges.

## Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Flair Furniture Production Optimization

Maximize profit for a furniture manufacturer producing tables and chairs with the following considerations:
- Limited carpentry and painting resources
- Capacity constraints for production
- Different profit margins for standard and extra production
- Minimum production requirements

### Problem 2: Advertising Budget Allocation

Minimize goal deviation penalties for an advertising campaign across three media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper) while balancing:
- Budget constraints
- Customer reach targets
- Media mix requirements
- Multiple competing objectives with different priority weights

## Technologies and Tools Used

### Programming Language
- Python 3.x

### Key Libraries
- **Gurobi Optimizer**: Commercial optimization solver for linear and integer programming
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization for feasible region plotting

## Optimization Techniques Learned

### Integer Programming
- Formulation of integer decision variables
- Handling of discrete optimization problems
- Multiple solution exploration using solution pools

### Linear Programming
- Constraint formulation and management
- Objective function design
- Feasible region analysis

### Goal Programming
- Multi-objective optimization
- Penalty weight assignment
- Deviation variable implementation
- Priority-based decision making

### Solution Analysis
- Alternative optimal solutions identification
- Sensitivity analysis through penalty evaluation
- Cost-benefit trade-off analysis
- Graphical representation of feasible regions

## Key Findings

### Furniture Production Problem
- Identified 31 integer solutions achieving maximum profit of 3300
- Discovered multiple optimal solutions along constraint boundaries
- Demonstrated trade-offs between standard and extra production

### Advertising Optimization Problem  
- Newspaper advertising proved most cost-effective per customer reached
- Budget penalties less critical than customer reach penalties
- TV advertising penalties more acceptable than TV ad costs
- Optimal solution: 150 newspaper ads, no TV or radio ads

## Academic Context

This project was completed as part of a university course on optimization and operations research, demonstrating practical applications of mathematical programming in business decision-making.
